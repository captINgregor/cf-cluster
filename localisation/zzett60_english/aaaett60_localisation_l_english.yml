 # naval_helicopter_equipment_1:"Naval Helicopter I"
 # naval_helicopter_equipment_1_short:"ASW Helo I"
 # naval_helicopter_equipment_1_desc:"Anti-Submarine helicopters and their vessels have two advantages over a submarine. Those are speed and standoff. The helicopter can gain an advantage by its speed to search and locate a submarine. Once a submarine has been located the vessel then has the advantage to stand off while the helicopter attacks the submarine. The helicopter is immune to any counter attack from a submarine"
 # naval_helicopter_equipment_2:"Naval Helicopter II"
 # naval_helicopter_equipment_2_short:"ASW Helo II"
 # naval_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:"Anti-submarine helicopters are expensive to build and maintain, and historical encounters between surface vessels and submarines occur mostly when defending convoys. Thus, not every ship should be equipped with anti-submarine helicopters. Helo-equipped hunter-killer ASW carriers and true helo-equipped destroyers are a good balance between the expense and advantages that these vessels offer."
 
 # utility_helicopter_equipment:"Utility Helicopter"
 # utility_helicopter_equipment_1:"Utility Helicopter I"
 # utility_helicopter_equipment_1_short:"Utility Helo I"
 # utility_helicopter_equipment_1_desc:"There are seven main types of modern helicopters; attack, transport, observation, utility, maritime, multi-role, and search and rescue helicopters. During WWII the main roles for helicopters were; observation, transport, and search and rescue. The German Focke-Achegelis Fa 330 was towed behind a u-boat and used for observation. Luftwaffe Transportstaffel 40 transported prisoners, and conducted a search and rescue mission for a lost German pilot. The U.S. army sent Sikorsky helicopters to the China-Bruma-India theater for rescue work, search and rescue of downed airmen. US helicopters were also used to transport aircraft parts in the south Pacific."
 # utility_helicopter_equipment_2:"Utility Helicopter II"
 # utility_helicopter_equipment_2_short:"Utility Helo II"
 # utility_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:"During WWII helicopters had little impact on the outcome of the war; however, their development and use continued. The US had six different models in service during the Korean War, and by the Vietnam War the use of helicopters had expanded again. The US 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) deployed helicopters on a large scale. They were used as troop carriers, cargo lift ships, medivacs, and as aerial rocket artillery. This mix of technology and troops allows a division to deploy into combat when and where ever it is needed."

It is a single rotor and engine light helicopter that was manufactured by Bell Helicopter. The US Navy began procurement of this helicopter with the HTL-2 and HTL-3. The HTL-4 was the first major version, and the HTL-5 with a 0-335-5 engine followed. An HTL-6 and HTL-7 also saw service with the navy."

The Army adopted the Seabat as the Choctaw in 1955 and the Marine Corps in 1957 as the S-58 Seahorse. It was capable of carrying 18 combat ready soldiers or a 1350kg load. The Choctaw went on to become a commercial success."

It earned the nickname 'Huey' because of its initial designation HU-1A, and it is most famous for its use in the Vietnam War. The primary uses were transporting troops, medical evac, cargo transport, and aerial attack. The Huey was the first turbine-equipped US Helicopter to go into production."

The jet turbine was not to power the rotors but to provide forward thrust for the autogyro. Forward momentum would engage the rotors for vertical flight. A 14-cylinder BMW 801D star engine was proposed and the landing stand would have been retractable. Lateral steering was to be either two rear rotors mounted in a V-shape tail or the engine exhaust gases directed out the sides of the hull."

During its first flight in 1953, the aircraft displayed many issues like engine flameouts and hiccuping. The aircraft was completely redesigned and production was ordered in 1955. However, after 5 aircraft had been built the program was cancelled. The Soviet Air Force had cancelled the plane because their doctrine had shifted from close air support to tactical nuclear weapon usage. The Il-40 never saw combat and only served with the USSR."

Although the program was rejected by the Soviet Air Force, Ilyushin continued the project as a private venture. 2 Prototypes were constructed, 1 of which make its maiden flight in 1982. The aircraft was never used in active service or exported."

It’s not until 1955 that the Ka-15 received government approval and production began in 1956. It is the first mass-produced helicopter and its use was both military and commercial. The Ka-15 was the commercial variation and the Ka-15M was used by the Soviet Navy. A four seat version, Kamov Ka-18 Hog, was also developed. Kamov Design Bureau is the rotorcraft manufacturing company that is located just outside of Moscow. Its alias name Hen is the Nato reporting name. Soviet helicopters were given a nickname starting with the letter H."

In comparison to the Chickasaw this helicopter has strong resemblance, but it is larger, able to lift more weight, and built in larger numbers. This helicopter was the foundation that the Soviet Army Aviation was built upon. Both military and civil aviation used this helicopter for several decades. Over 4,000 Hounds of all variants were produced, and some were still in limited service in North Korea as late as 2014."

It saw limited service in the Soviet Airforce, and it is believed that less than 100 helicopters were produced. The first flight was on 3 July 1952 and it has since been retired from active service, but that date is unknown. The Yak-24 could carry 30 airborne troops, or 18 stretchers, or 3,000 Kg of cargo. Production of this helicopter was ended due to technical problems, and the more successful Mil Mi-6 took over as a heavy transport helicopter."

This engine design limited the useful life span of this helicopter because more powerful turboshaft designs were being developed in the 1950’s. Of the 154 Ch-37 that were built the navy took two helicopters. The army and marine corps took the reset. No other nations placed any orders as this design was too expensive to order and operate Four Ch-37’s were deployed to the Vietnam conflict for downed US aircraft recovery."

It can transport 65 soldiers, or 41 stretchers with two attendants, or light AVF’s. Over 900 Mi-6 were built (for both military and civil use) from 1959 to 1980, and the Hook was retired from service in 2002."

 nsb_gyrocopter:"Early Helicopter Applications"
 nsb_gyrocopter_short:"Early Helicopter"
 nsb_gyrocopter_desc:"The gyrocopter was invented by a Spanish engineer, Juan de la Cierva, and flown on 9 Jan 1923 at Cuatro Veintos Airfiled, Madrid. It was referred to as the autogyro and it resembled a fixed wing aircraft. This was the first rotary aircraft to have flown successfully. A gyrocopter is unlike a helicopter because the rotors are not powered. Lift occurs when air moves across the blades, thus causing the rotor to spin. Development of the gyrocopter would eventually lead to vertical take off and landings. War time use was mostly for aerial surveillance."

 night_vision3_desc:0 "Research into Night Vision Devices (NVDs) began in 1929, and the NVD equipment that was used during WWII is now considered Generation 0. Two platoons of Panthers were equipped with the Sperber FG 1250, and the StG-44 with the Vampir ZG 1229. The Soviet Union conducted field tests of the PAU-2 in 1942. The US Army tested the M-1 and M-3 infrared night sighting devices, and in the Korean War this equipment saw limited service assisting snipers."
 infantry_at3_desc:0 "Post war time development of infantry anti-tank weapons focused on two goals. The first is that anti-tank weapons must be able to defeat post war heavy tanks, and second they must be lightweight and portable for infantry."
 infantry_at4_desc:0 "In 1955 the first wire-guided missile, Nord Aviation SS.10, entered service in the French Army. It’s development was inspired by the war time German Ruhrstahl X-4 missile."
 support_weapons5_desc:0 "Post war time development of support weapons focused on improving these weapons. Improvements to the M1919 Browning machine gun included a new cartridge and disintegrating belt links. The weapon was lighter, but still too heavy for combat and thus it was not adopted." 
 support_weapons6_desc:0 "Efforts to improve machine guns continued, and in the West a standard Nato grade cartridge was adopted. The Mk 21 was a US Navy conversion of the M1919A4 that fired the 7.62mm Nato cartridge. The M2HB Browning was required to perforate 22.2mm of armour at 91m with armour-piercing ammunition. Both the German MG 42 and Soviet DShK were modernized. The MG 42 would be redesigned as the MG3. Medium machine guns are now classified as GPMG (general-purpose machine guns)."
 armored_car_equipment_3_desc:0 "Mobility should be prioritized for new armored car designs. A more powerful engine would best fit this requirement for modern armored cars."
 armored_car_equipment_4_desc:0 "Firepower should be prioritized for new armored car designs. A large caliber weapon mounted in a turret would be best for this requirement for more firepower."
 armored_car_equipment_5_desc:0 "Modern communications should be prioritized for new armored car designs."

 amphibious_mechanized_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Amphibious Vehicle, Tracked (LVT), used by the US Marine Corp, was redesigned in 1949 as the LVT-3C. It had an armoured roof and the bow was extended to improve the boyance."
 tech_engineers5_desc:0 "Field engineers facilitate the mobility of friendly forces while impeding enemy mobility. They work to assure the survivability of friendly forces through the use of specialized knowledge and engineering equipment."
 tech_engineers6_desc:0 "Field engineers perform a variety of military tasks that could include mine warfare, bridging and road construction, construction of or breaching trenches and other obstacles, and fighting alongside regular infantry."
 tech_recons5_desc:0 "Reconnaissance is the exploration of an area by military forces to obtain information about enemy forces, terrain, and other activities. It is often called recce by the British military or recon by the American military."
 tech_recons6_desc:0 "Information gathered by field recce can be by area, route, or zone. Area is a specified location, route may be a road, railway, waterway, or narrow axis of advance, and zone is detailed information about the enemy’s location, strengths, and weaknesses."
 tech_military_police5_desc:0 "New police forensic techniques need to be developed to help crush any remaining underground resistance."
 tech_military_police6_desc:0 "With the help of new electronic technologies we can improve upon our surveillance of occupied territories for new resistance groups."
 tech_maintenance_company5_desc:0 "Priority should be given to developing an apprenticeship program that will provide our maintenance personnel with the skills needed to complete repairs efficiently."
 tech_maintenance_company6_desc:0 "Specialized equipment needs to be developed so that our maintenance personnel can carry out complex maintenance, repairs or overhauls."
 tech_field_hospital5_desc:0 "The basic structure of a mobile medical unit was established by Major Marran in Patton’s Third Army during WWII. His method of providing medical aid sooner to wounded soldiers was admirade and supported by the command structure. However, it was not until the Korean War that this method of triage was officially adopted by the US military." 
 tech_field_hospital6_desc:0 "During the Korean War the US military established mobile army surgical hospitals for providing medical care to wounded soldiers. MASH units were an improvement over the random individual systems of portable surgical hospitals that were used during WWII. Wounded soldiers are first treated on the line and then sent to a battalion aid station to be stabilized. From there they go to a MASH unit for extensive treatment."
 tech_logistics_comapany5_desc:0 "With advance planning and forecasting techniques we can improve on our distribution of supplies."
 tech_logistics_comapany6_desc:0 "With modern equipment that is designed around logistics needs we can handle a greater amount of supplies."
 tech_signal_company5_desc:0 "Policies and procedures for comms personnel need to be improved upon so that the enemy can not glean any significant information while intercepting our communications."

Even during the war the Sturmgewehr (StG) 44 greatly increased the volume of fire when compared to the standard infantry rifle. After the war the StG 45, a wartime Mauser prototype, had a significant influence on post war weapon designs. The main focus was to design an assault rifle which was to be gas-operated, selective fire, and have a 20-round magazine."

The Italians designed the LF-59, the Japanese designed the Type 64, and the Germans designed the HK33. The USA, Britain, and the Soviet Union’s weapons development were continuous from wartime to peacetime. The US M-14 rifle comes from improvements made to the M1 Garand. The development of M-16 continues with this process and standardization follows for the Nato countries; ie, 7.62 and 5.56 Nato cartridges. The countries behind the Iron Curtain look to the AK-47, and its variants, as their main battle rifles."

 USA_anti_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "The M5 3-inch Gun began development in late 1940 and it was based on the 3 inch AA gun T9. The initial design was mounted on an M2 howitzer carriage and this was ready by Sept 1941. There were minor problems with this combination and a modified gun carriage called the M6 was used. Production began in Dec 1942 and when deployed it was considered too heavy. It was phased out of service in favour of self-propelled tank destroyers."
 USA_anti_tank_equipment_5:0 "M27 105mm Recoilless Rifle"
 USA_anti_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "The M27 Recoilless Rifle is a 105mm breech-loaded, single-shot, man-portable, crew-served recoilless rifle. It can be used in both anti-tank and anti-personnel roles. Development for a recoilless rifle began during WWII with a demonstration of a 57mm recoilless rifle. Larger calibers were recommended, but development was halted in June 1947. The Korean war saw the revival of the project and the extensive use of the M27."
 USA_anti_tank_equipment_6:0 "M40 Recoiless Rifle"
 USA_anti_tank_equipment_6_desc:0 "The M40 Recoilless Rifle is a portable crew-served 105mm recoiless rifle and attached is an M8C .50 cal spotting rifle. The trajectory of a .50 cal round closely matches that of the 105mm round and a puff of smoke will occur on impact. The 105mm is then fired with a successful hit of the .50 cal."
 USA_anti_tank_equipment_7:0 "Nord MGM-21"
 USA_anti_tank_equipment_7_desc:0 "The Nord MGM-21 is the US version of the French Nord Aviation SS.10 AT missile. It is a MCLOS (manual controlled line of sight) wire-guided AT missile. The missile was phased out after a few short years in service for the French MGM-31 Entac."
 
 anti_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "War-time improvements to AT guns was necessary due to an increased thickness of tank armour. This in time would result in the development of heavier tanks and even better AT guns. By war's end AT guns would be 85mm and larger. The 128mm Pak 44 was Germany's last war-time AT gun."
 anti_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "Post war-time AT gun development continued with larger and more powerful AT guns. The Soviet Union made improvements to its 85mm gun with the introduction of the D-48 85mm gun, and the US Army continued with its development of AT recoilless rifles."
 anti_tank_equipment_6_desc:0 "Improvements to AT capabilities in a post-war era saw the Soviets introduce a larger AT gun - the T-12 100mm Gun. The US Army continued working on recoilless rifles, and the development resulted in deployment of the M40 Recoilless Rifle (105mm rifle with the M8C .50cal spotting rifle attached)."
 anti_tank_equipment_7_desc:0 "Post WWII AT missiles were MCLOS (manual controlled line of sight) wire-guided missiles. Operators of these weapon systems would guide the missile to its target by line of sight. The operator had to be well trained in using an MCLOS missile, and undisturbed when guiding the missile to its target."
 antitank65_desc:0 "New designs in ammunition, such as APDS, will enhance our anti-tank capabilities."

 GER_anti_tank_equipment_4:0 "12,8 cm PaK 44"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "The 12.8 cm Pak 44 was initially developed as a field gun in 1943. The appearance of the Russian IS-2’s on the Eastern Front altered the requirements as an improved anti-gun was now needed. The Pak 44 has short to medium-range performance similar to the Pak 43, but it maintains better anti-tank performance over long to extreme-ranges (1,800 to 2,700m and beyond)."
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_7:0 "Ruhrstahl X-7"
 GER_anti_tank_equipment_7_desc:0 "The X-7 Rotkäppchen anti-tank missile was designed and developed by Ruhrstahl AG in 1943. A few hundred X-7’s were produced at the Brackwede factory, and unconfirmed reports say the missile was used successfully on the Eastern Front. After the war French engineers developed the Nord SS. 10 from the X-7 design."

 ENG_mechanized_equipment_4_desc:0 "The Centurion Kangaroo was a field modification made by the Israel Defense Force for use in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. The idea of a kangaroo armoured personnel carrier originates in WWII. M3 and M5 Stuarts were used in Africa, but they were light armoured. The Canadian Army made field modifications in July of 1944. Self-propelled artillery and tanks were over-supplied to the army and the American M3 half-track was undersupplied. 72 M7 Priests were converted and other Commonwealth Forces would follow the lead of the Canadians by using the Kangaroos."

 mechanized_equipment_4_desc:0 "An APC is broadly defined as an armoured vehicle that is designed to transport personnel or equipment into combat zones. There may be light weapons, less than 20mm cannons, that are used for defending the vehicle and crew from enemy attacks, but they do not provide direct fire in support of the battle."
 mechanized_equipment_5_desc:0 "The APC’s that were used during WWII include the American M3 half track, the German Sd. Kfz. 251, and the British Universal Carrier. They evolved from simple armoured cars with transport capacity to purpose built vehicles. The importance of having soldiers accompany tanks into battle became obvious as armies gained the battle field experience that they need in fighting modern wars. Technology was advancing rapidly and this ushered in new weapon systems and tactics."
 mechanized_equipment_6_desc:0 "The Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) evolved out of the APC, and it was after WWII that these vehicles were deployed by militaries around the world. The French AMX-VCI (Véhicule de Combat d`Infanterie) incorporates many of the characteristics now associated with a modern IVF. Those characteristics are an armoured vehicle that is designed and equipped to transport infantry into battle, with at least a 20mm cannon and sometimes an antitank missile, and provide direct fire in support of the battle."
 mechanized_equipment_7_desc:0 "Early IFVs are the German Schützenpanzer Lang HS.30 (also known simply as the SPz 12-3) and the French AMX-VCI (Véhicule de Combat d`Infanterie). These vehicles were purpose built to maneuver and fight with tanks."
